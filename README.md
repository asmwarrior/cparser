# CParser

`CParser` is a standalone C parser library written in C++, that can be easily embedded in other software projects. The library is contained of reusable set of classes.

## Demo usage of the library
See `src/cformat.cpp`, `include/GenCVisitor.h` and `src/GenCVisitor.cpp` for the demo source which uses the C parser library. `cformat` is an implementation of a simple C code style formatter.
To clone the project and build the demo, type:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jkolek/cparser.git
$ cd cparser
$ make
```
To run the demo with example C file, type:
```
$ ./cformat test/example1.c
```

## How to use the library

To use the library you can simply implement your own visitor class by inheriting `TreeVisitor` class similarly like `GenCVisitor` (used by the `cformat`) does. Then with this visitor you can traverse abstract syntax tree generated by parser.


## Current work

My current objectives are to make the parser to be able to parse preprocessed files
like for example `test/cpp_out_example.c`, and to finish the `GenCVisitor` implementation.

Thank you for your interest in my project. Any feedback would be highly appreciated!
